/**
 * Whether the learning helped, asked of the shoppers who were kept away from it.
 *
 * Both sides are counted the same way over the same window: how often the widget was opened after
 * being seen, clicked after being opened, and so on down to an order. The difference between the
 * two rates is the whole claim, and it is only made when there is enough on both sides to make it
 * — a rate from forty exposures is a rumour.
 *
 * The verdict is allowed to be "too early", and for a young shop it usually should be. A system
 * that reports an improvement every week it is asked is not measuring anything.
