/**
 * The conversation that is trying to get somewhere, as a machine rather than a conversation.
 *
 * A model asked to collect a phone number will collect a phone number, and it will also ask twice,
 * accept "0500000000", forget the consent, and one day decide a postcode would be useful. None of
 * that is a prompt problem. So the whole of it is here, in code: which field comes next, whether
 * what was typed is a real one, when consent is required, and when to stop asking.
 *
 * What the model does in this flow is answer questions about the page, which is what it is good
 * at. It never sees a field, never sees an answer, and never decides the next step.
 *
 * The machine holds no state of its own. The widget sends back what it has so far and is told
 * what to do next, so a reader who reloads the page loses a step rather than a lead, and nothing
 * about them sits in a session anywhere.
