/**
 * Everything code can learn about a shop, read again, every night.
 *
 * Until now a product that arrived today was known about only once somebody remembered to type a
 * command. Every reader here costs nothing to run and skips what has not changed — a product
 * whose text is the same as last night is recognised by its hash and left alone — so the honest
 * default is to run all of them nightly and stop asking anyone.
 *
 * They run in the order they depend on each other: products are read before they can be ranked,
 * and ranked before relations can use the ranking. A step that throws does not take the rest of
 * the night with it; it is recorded and the next one runs, because a shop with four readings out
 * of five done is in a better state than a shop with one.
