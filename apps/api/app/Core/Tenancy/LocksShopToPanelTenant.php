 * For an admin screen that serves one shop at a time: the shop is the panel's tenant and nothing
 * else can change it.
 *
 * The screens these pages extend keep the shop in a public, URL-bound property so an operator can
 * switch shops. In a tenant panel that property is an open door: Livewire hydrates it from the
 * request on every update, so a shop id put into the address would be read back and used. Setting
 * it once on mount is not enough — mount runs on the first load only.
 *
 * So the shop is written back from the tenant at every point the property could have changed: when
 * the component is hydrated, when it boots, on mount, and if anything assigns it mid-request.
 * Filament has already checked that this user may open this tenant.
